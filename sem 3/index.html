                            <h4>Eco-Friendly Educational Chart: Advanced Low-Cost Innovation Using Newspaper and Homemade Glue</h4>
                            <p>During our B.Ed. third semester, we continued to refine our innovative teaching aid creation skills by designing advanced eco-friendly educational charts using recycled newspaper and homemade glue. Building on our first semester experience, this project focused on more complex educational concepts and improved presentation techniques. The chart was crafted using old newspapers as the foundation, with flour-and-water based glue, demonstrating our growing expertise in sustainable, cost-effective educational material development. This third semester project showcased our enhanced creativity, improved resourcefulness, and deeper understanding of environmental sustainability in education. These practices continue to prepare us as future educators who can adapt low-cost methods effectively, particularly valuable in resource-constrained educational environments while promoting environmental consciousness among students.</p>
